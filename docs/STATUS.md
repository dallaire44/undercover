# Status

A hello-world skeleton with every check in place:

- `backend/`: one route, `GET /api/health`
- `agent/`: the entry point `run(claim_id, thread_id)`, with one tool that calls the health route
- `dashboard/`: one page that shows whether the backend is up
- `e2e/`: one test of that page

Nothing of UnderCover is built yet. Update this file as you build.

## Commit guard

`.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/guard-commit.mjs` stop Claude Code from committing with `--no-verify`, `git commit -n`, `LEFTHOOK=0` or `core.hooksPath`. Blocks go to `~/.claude/blocked-commits.log`, and every `git` command it sees goes to `~/.claude/guard-calls.log`.
